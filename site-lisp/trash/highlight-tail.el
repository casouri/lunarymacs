;;; Commentary:

;; === WHAT IS IT?
;;
;; This minor-mode draws a tail in real time, when you write.  It
;; changes the background color of some last typed characters and
;; smoothly fade them out to the background color.
;;
;; So from now on, your Emacs will be even more sexy! ;o )
;;
;; If you do not understand what I mean, check the animation:
;; http://nic-nac-project.net/~necui/img/htshow.gif
;;
;; === INSTALLATION
;;
;; Place this file in your load-path and add
;;
;; (require 'highlight-tail)
;; (message "Highlight-tail loaded - now your Emacs will be even more sexy!")
;; ;
;; ; [ here some setq of variables - see CONFIGURATION section below ]
;; ;
;; (highlight-tail-mode)
;;
;; to your ~/.emacs
;;
;; === CONFIGURATION
;;
;; The default configuration is quite good, but you could and should
;; customize it to your own needs.  Here are some examples.  It's hard
;; for me to explain what you will see when use them, so just give
;; them a try.  Place these setq in your .emacs.el file *before* the
;; (highlight-tail-mode) function call.
;;
;; 1. -----
;;
;; (setq highlight-tail-colors '(("black" . 0)
;;                               ("#bc2525" . 25)
;;                               ("black" . 66)))
;; 
;; 2. -----
;;
;; (setq highlight-tail-steps 14
;;       highlight-tail-timer 1)
;; 
;; 3. -----
;; 
;; (setq highlight-tail-posterior-type 'const)
;;
;; These are all customizable variables.  I think you get the idea
;; how to customize this mode for best fit.
;; 
;; ATTENTION
;;
;; You will often need to run (highlight-tail-reload) function to make
;; changes work :).
;;
;; === SPEED
;;
;; From version 0.8 this mode doesn't use much CPU power.  There were
;; problems with this in earlier versions.  Now it takes about 2-8% of
;; my Athlon XP 2000+ power in normal speed typing (maybe it is still
;; too much? - if you have suggestions how to make it eat less - mail
;; me).  When I press a key and hold it down it eats approximately 15%
;; (in comparison to prior version (100%) it is a very good result).
;; The CPU eaten depends mainly on two variables:
;; `highlight-tail-steps' and `highlight-tail-timer'.  So combine with
;; these two to achieve satisfactory performance.
;;
;; === Terminals
;;
;; Highlight-tail doesn't work on terminals (only in window-systems
;; like X11)

;;; History:

;; * 1.3.9 (02 Apr 2007)
;;      + highlight-tail-mode function does do start highlight-tail
;;        now.  You can change (highlight-tail-reload) call to
;;        (highlight-tail-mode) in you .emacs file, but it's not
;;        necessary.  Thanks to Daniel Engeler for reporting.
;;
;; * 1.3.8 (17 Nov 2006)
;;      + Overlays that had fade out are now reused later instead of
;;        being left to the garbage collector.  Thanks to Markus
;;        Triska for reporting.
;; 
;; * 1.3.7 (14 Nov 2006)
;;      + Made `highlight-tail-reload' function interactive, so it can
;;        be evaluated with `execute-extended-command' (M-x).  Thanks
;;        to Markus Triska for reporting.
;;      + No line exceeds 79 column, better coding-style in few places.
;;
;; * 1.3.6 (11 Nov 2006)
;;      + No line exceeds 80 column.
;; 
;; * 1.3.5 (11 Nov 2006)
;;      + Do not activate if run under terminal (because it leads to
;;        errors).
;;
;; * 1.3.4 (01 Nov 2006)
;;      + Use `color-values' function instead of
;;        `color-name-rgb-alist' variable so that highlight-tail
;;        should work in Emacs on Windows and is simpler.  Thanks to
;;        Kevin Rodgers for reporting.
;;      + cl is now used only at compile time.  Thanks to Richard
;;        Stallman for reporting.
;;
;; * 1.3.3 (30 Oct 2006)
;;      + Added (require 'cl).  Thanks to Arnaldo Mandel and Kevin
;;        Rodgers for reporting.
;;      + Many less warnings on compilation.  Thanks to Kevin Rodgers.
;; 
;; * 1.3.2 (29 Oct 2006)
;;      + Fixed the way the number of steps between every two colors
;;        are computed.
;;      + Added a test on `highlight-tail-colors' to enforce its
;;        correctness.
;; 
;; * 1.3.1 (28 Oct 2006)
;;      + Minor documentation corrections.
;;
;; * 1.3 (28 Oct 2006)
;;      + Fading out to the *current* background color.  You no longer
;;        need to specify background color (the one at 100%) in
;;        `highlight-tail-colors' variable.  highlight-tail-mode will
;;        discover it on its own and is vigilant about future changes:
;;        3sec. timer holds an eye on it.
;;      + What's more: if there is some overlay or text property that
;;        change background color, highlight-tail will discover it and
;;        fade out to this color.
;;      + Some corrections in the documentation and comments.
;;      
;; * 1.2 (25 Aug 2006)
;;      + Now works with org-mode and orgtbl-mode.  Thanks to William
;;        Xu for reporting.
;;      + You can now choose a color by name in XEmacs.
;;      + XEmacs related bug with itimer fixed.
;;      + Fixed some typos and errors in the documentation.
;; 
;; * 1.1.1
;;      + Updated information about web page (up; new address (the old
;;        one works though)).
;;
;; * 1.1
;;      + Fixed serious bug in the documentation (in installation section).
;;        Thanks to Mathias Dahl for reporting.
;;
;; * 1.0
;;      + Nothing new, I just think 0.9.3 is so stable to honor it with
;;        round version number.
;;
;; * 0.9.3
;;      + Added information about highlight-tail.el web page.
;;      + Front highlighting removed completely... It wasn't nice and
;;        there were too many troubles with it.
;;      + highlight-tail.el taken under subversion control
;;
;; * 0.9.2
;;      + Colors can be passed with uppercase letters in.
;;      + If you choose a color, that doesn't exist in
;;        `color-name-rgb-alist', mode will call out an error instead of
;;        running "illegible" debugger ;).
;;      + The variable (i)timer-list is now cleaned from old timers on
;;        `highlight-tail-reload' call.
;;      + All overlays are deleted on `highlight-tail-reload' call.
;;      + Several minor bugs fixed.
;;
;; * 0.9.1
;;      + Region kept alive in XEmacs, when going to the end of line.
;;        Thanks to Nate Drake for reporting this bug.
;;      + Functions broken into smaller parts.
;;
;; * 0.9
;;      + Now under GPL.
;;      + Changed start, middle and end colors to a list of indefinable length
;;      + Added front and constant highlighting options.
;;      + Changed lists to hashes and vectors for speed (I don't really know
;;        did this help.)
;;
;; * 0.8
;;      + Eats a lot less of CPU cycles than before.  Thanks to
;;        Phillip Lord for some advices how to achieve it.
;;      + Works good under XEmacs.
;;      + Added middle color option
;;
;; * 0.7
;;      + First public version.

;;; TODO:

;; * Maybe some optimizations for speed.
;; * Make some way for highlight-tail to perfectly work with modes
;;   that rebind "normal" keys (like c-electric-mode).  Unfortunately
;;   this could be very hard or impossible.  Right now there is no
;;   highlighting on rebinded keys (like: colons, parens etc. in
;;   c-electric-mode).
;;
;; You are free to mail me, what would you like to see in this
;; mode, or maybe you have idea for new emacs eye-candy minor-mode.
