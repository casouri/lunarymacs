;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package lets you toggle your interactive console for any major
;; mode. You can:
;;
;;   1. Switch back and forth between main buffer and console buffer
;;   2. Toggle a console window a the bottom
;;   3. Switch between the console window and the main window
;;
;; There are two commands ‘luna-toggle-console’ (1 & 3) and
;; ‘luna-toggle-console-window’ (2). See their doc string for more
;; info. Edit ‘luna-console-buffer-alist’ to add buffer name pattern
;; for each major mode. Use ‘luna-set-console-buffer’ to quickly set a
;; console buffer for current buffer.
