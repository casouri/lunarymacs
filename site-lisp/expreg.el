;;; expreg.el --- Simple expand region  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This is just like expand-region, but (1) we generate all regions at
;; once, and (2) should be easier to debug. Bind ‘expreg-expand’ and
;; ‘expreg-contract’ and start using it.

;;; Developer
;;
;; It works roughly as follows: ‘expreg-expand’ collects a list of
;; possible expansions on startup with functions in
;; ‘expreg-functions’. Then it sorts them by each region’s size. It
;; also removes duplicates, etc. Then this list is stored in
;; ‘expreg--next-regions’. (There could be better sorting algorithms,
;; but so far I haven’t seen the need for one.)
;;
;; To expand, we pop a region from ‘expreg--next-regions’, set point
;; and mark accordingly, and push this region to
;; ‘expreg--prev-regions’. So the head of ‘expreg--prev-regions’
;; should always equal the current region.
;;
;; ‘expreg-contract’ does just the opposite: it pops a region from
;; ‘expreg--prev-regions’, push it to ‘expreg--next-regions’, and set
;; the current region to the head of ‘expreg--prev-regions’.
;;
;; For better debugability, each region is of the form
;;
;;     (FN . (BEG . END))
;;
;; where FN is the function produced this region. So accessing BEG is
;; ‘cadr’, accessing END is ‘cddr’. Sometimes FN is the function name
;; plus some further descriptions, eg, word, word--symbol,
;; word--within-space are all produced by ‘expreg--word’. I use double
;; dash to indicate the additional descriptor.
;;
;; Credit: I stole a lot of ideas on how to expand lists and strings
;; from ‘expand-region’ :-)

  "A list of expansion functions.

Each function is called with no arguments and should return a
list of (BEG . END). The list don’t have to be sorted, and can
have duplicates. It’s also fine to include invalid regions, such

‘expreg-expand’.
