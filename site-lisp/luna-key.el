;; Home-brewed general.el. Though `luna-def-key' has some differences
;; with `general-define-key'. First, its modifiers (:keymaps, etc) are
;; stateful, meaning that it only affects definitions comes after it,
;; and the effect lasts until another modifiers overrides it. Second,
;; it implements “definers” feature in general by “preset” modifiers.
;; Lastly, of course, this package is much lighter than general.el.

  "Define key.

The :keymaps and :prefix modifiers specifies the keymaps and
prefix key for KEY DEF pairs below them. Modifiers only affect
the definitions after them, and their effect lasts until another
modifier overrides them. For example, to define KEY1 in MAP1 and
KEY2 in MAP2:

  (luna-key-def
   :keymaps 'MAP1
   KEY1 DEF1
   :keymaps 'MAP2n
   KEY2 DEF2)

Unlike in `define-key', MAP is the symbol of a keymap, rather than
the keymap itself. MAP can also be nil, which is interpreted as
`global-map', or 'override, which is interpreted as the override
keymap defined by luna-key, or a list of these three forms. KEY
and DEF can be anything that `define-key' accepts. `kbd' is
automatically added to KEY but not DEF.

You can also use preset modifiers defined by `luna-key-def-preset'.
They are basically macros that expand to other modifiers.

Use :clear to reset all modifier effects. :--- is an alias for :clear.

Use :when FUNC to conditionally bind commands. FUNC takes no
arguments, returns a non-nil value when the binding should take
effect, and returns nil when the binding shouldn’t take effect.
