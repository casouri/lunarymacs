;;; iscroll.el --- Smooth scrolling over images      -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Author: Yuan Fu <casouri@gmail.com>

;;; This file is NOT part of GNU Emacs

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Gone are the days when images jumps in and out of the window when
;; scrolling! This package makes scrolling over images as if the image
;; is made of many lines, instead of a single line. (Indeed, sliced
;; image with default scrolling has the similar behavior as what this
;; package provides.)
;;
;; To use this package:
;;
;;     M-x iscroll-mode RET
;;
;; This mode remaps mouse scrolling functions and `next/previous-line'.
;; If you use other commands, you need to adapt them accordingly. See
;; `iscroll-mode-map' and `iscroll-mode' for some inspiration.
;;
;; If a line is taller than double the default line height, smooth
;; scrolling is triggered and Emacs will reveal one line’s height each
;; time.
;;
;; Commands provided:
;;
;; - iscroll-up
;; - iscroll-down
;; - iscroll-next-line
;; - iscroll-previous-line
;;
;; Used to be image-scroll.el, but image-scroll-up/down collide with
;; image.el
;;
;; Limitations:
;;
;; - Scrolling over images in other window sometimes doesn’t work.
;; - If you scroll over an image partially and move point to another
;;   window, sometimes the image jumps back to display completely.
;; - If there is only one line after an image, you can’t scroll that
;;   image down. Why? I have no idea.


;;; Developer
;;
;; About the implementation:
;;
;; Scrolling n lines once is much more efficient than scrolling 1 line
;; n times (see benchmarks at the end of the file). So we prefer
;; scrolling in batch. For that reason, we try to do a ”dry run”
;; before actually scrolling. ”Dry run” means moving point when
;; scrolling over logical lines, and simply incrementing vscroll
;; amount when scrolling over images. When we finished the dry-run, we
;; apply the logical scrolls with `set-window-start’ and vscroll
;; amount with `set-window-vscroll’.
;;
;; In practice this is indeed much more efficient when ARG (number of
;; lines to scroll) is larger than 1. That’s important for me because
;; I usually scroll 3 lines at once.

;;; Code:
