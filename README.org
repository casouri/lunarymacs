*Notice* (<2018-12-10 Mon>): Now I use [[https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs/wiki/cowboy][my own package manager]], consider this if you want to try out lunarymacs.

This is a stripped down framework modeling after doom-emacs. It's extremely basic, but working for me.

*Warning:* There is no seat belt.

- *code is easy* to understand. There aren't much cool abstractions.
- *not opinionated*: ([[https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs/blob/324b6f8739ccd6fd43aa29009c566048ec180def/core/core-ui.el#L7][except this]]) no default settings set in core.
- *minimum* core files. Only three

* Quick start
  
Lunarymacs is separated into =core= and =config=. 
=core= is this repo, and =config= is my personal configurations (stars/modules) in a separate repo. You can clone only this repo and write your own stars, or clone both and modify my config.

Lunarymacs doesn't check packages on startup. Instead, you use Make commands to install, update and delete packages.

*backup you .emacs.d first*

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
# clone core
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs.git ~/.emacs.d
cd ~/.emacs.d
# clone my config
git clone https://github.com/casouri/lunarymacs-stars.git star
# my init.el is under star/ while init.example.el is under .emacs.d/
# don't cp my init.el unless you use Emacs 26+ on macOS 10.13+

# angel star(emacs layout) and evil star (vim layout) might
# not be compatible. Chose the one you like.
cpp init.example.el init.el
make
emacs

# to update lunarymacs
git pull --rebase

# or
make update-moon # it's the same
#+END_SRC
* After installation

Each star has a README file, Key bindings are on the top of every star's config file.

* Thank you
Thanks to all the contributors of spacemacs and doom-emacs. I copyied a lot of code from them.
Thanks to everyone in emacs-china.org, you answered many questions of mine.
And of course a big thank-you to all the package contributors and emacs contributors. I can't enjoy such a great editor without your effort.
Emacs community is the best! :smile: :heart: (just rhetorical, not comparing :P)
